**Python Crypter & Virtual Execution Runtime**

---

## Overview

**0BeeF** is a powerful crypter and obfuscation tool for Python scripts. It is designed to:

* Obfuscate code at a deep level
* Encrypt payloads with multiple layers (Fernet + XOR)
* Execute decrypted payloads fully in-memory
* Evade antivirus (AV) detection
* Resist static and dynamic reverse engineering
* Wipe memory to remove traces after execution

---

## Features

* Obfuscation using `marshal`, `zlib`, `base64`
* Multi-layer encryption: Fernet (AES-CBC + HMAC) + XOR key masking
* Dynamic import injection to avoid static detection
* In-memory execution via `exec` and `memoryview`
* RAM wiping using `ctypes.memset`
* Anti-debugging using `sys.gettrace()` and `_getframe`
* Virtualized decryption environment using function-index mapping

---

## Usage

```bash
python ./src/0BeeF.py
```

Follow the prompt to select a `.py` file. The encrypted file will be saved with the prefix `0BeeF_`.

## Detection Reduction

In a real-world test using a Python-based stealer detected by 24 antivirus engines, 0BeeF reduced detection to 9 engines.
**Detection rate reduced by approximately 60.3%.**

## Recommendations

* Do **not** use `Nuitka` after encryption &mdash; it may optimize away the encryption logic (use the commercial version with flag `--enable-plugin=data-hiding` if needed)
* If your script is detected by **fewer than 12 AV engines**, you likely donâ€™t need 0BeeF
* You **can combine 0BeeF with PyArmor** for better protection
* Fully compatible with `PyInstaller`, `py2exe`, and similar tools **after** obfuscation

## How It Works

```
[ Python code ]
   â†“
[ marshal â†’ zlib â†’ base64 â†’ Fernet â†’ XOR ]
   â†“
Encrypted payload
   â†“
Stub script decrypts and executes code in memory
   â†“
Decrypted memory is wiped after execution
```

All decryption and execution occurs in memory, leaving no traces on disk.
