## Overview

**0BeeF** is a crypter and obfuscator for Python, built for **security research** and **source code protection**.

This project is designed to hide and protect Python scripts from prying eyesâ€”**0BeeF bridges the gap between simple encryption and sophisticated evasion techniques.**

It offers:

*   A multi-layer encryption mechanism to protect payloads.
*   Fully in-memory execution to evade static analysis.
*   Anti-debugging and anti-VM techniques.
*   Bytecode-level obfuscation.
*   A simple, easy-to-use command-line interface.

---

## Why 0BeeF?

*   **Great for security researchers** who want to learn about evasion techniques.
*   **Useful for developers** who must protect their intellectual property in Python scripts.
*   **Optimized for security over performance** â€” designed for tasks that require confidentiality rather than large-scale processing speed.

---

## Effectiveness Demo

Here is a real-world result of using 0BeeF on a Python-based stealer. The detection rate was **reduced by approximately 62.5%**.

## Core Features

* **Multi-Layer Encryption** â€” Hardens the payload against decryption attempts.
* **In-Memory Execution** â€” The payload is decrypted and run entirely in RAM.
* **Memory Wiping** â€” Automatically clears traces after execution.
* **Bytecode Obfuscation** â€” Resists static analysis and reverse engineering.
* **Anti-Debug & Anti-VM** â€” Detects and evades analysis environments.
* **High Compatibility** â€” Works well with PyInstaller and similar tools.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/memecoder12345678/0BeeF-Python-Crypter.git
cd 0BeeF
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run 0BeeF

```bash
python ./src/0BeeF.py
```

Then, follow the on-screen prompts to select the Python file you want to encrypt. The output file will be prefixed with `0BeeF_`.

---

## Recommendations

*   **Do not use `Nuitka`** after encryption, as its optimizations may break the encryption logic.
*   If your script is detected by **fewer than 8 AV engines**, you probably donâ€™t need 0BeeF.
*   You **can combine 0BeeF with PyArmor** for enhanced protection.
*   When bundling with `PyInstaller`, ensure that all hidden imports are declared manually.  
    See [hidden_import.txt](hidden_import.txt) for the complete list.
